# Lung-X-Ray-Image-Enhancement-To-Identify-Pneumonia-With-CNN

Pneumonia is a threatening infectious disorder affecting lungs in human beings that may be diagnosed through
taking chest X-rays having factors that define them. We appraise the functionality of pre-skilled CNN applied as
feature-extractors followed by using classifiers for the chest X-Rays to detect the presence of pneumonia. Statistical
effects received demonstrates the CNN model with supervised classifier algorithms used to study chest X-ray
images, particularly to stumble on Pneumonia.

## PROBLEM DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES
To make an efficient use of Machine Learning techniques. Provide solution with least
hardware requirement. To develop an application that is cost efficient. Minimize the
use of Treatment as Normal People cant afford costly equipment. Easy to use and
accurate so that medical can adopt the application quickly. To Implement application
to Detect Pneumonia in early stage by using Deep Learning Classification algorithm
are executed using Convocational Neural Network (CNN)
