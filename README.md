# Lung-X-Ray-Image-Enhancement-To-Identify-Pneumonia-With-CNN

Pneumonia is a threatening infectious disorder affecting lungs in human beings that may be diagnosed through
taking chest X-rays having factors that define them. We appraise the functionality of pre-skilled CNN applied as
feature-extractors followed by using classifiers for the chest X-Rays to detect the presence of pneumonia. Statistical
effects received demonstrates the CNN model with supervised classifier algorithms used to study chest X-ray
images, particularly to stumble on Pneumonia.
